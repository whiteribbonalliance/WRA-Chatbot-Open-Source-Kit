White Ribbon Alliance chatbot project logic and flows now available open-source for sharing and collaboration.

## WRA Global Social Impact Chatbot Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository of the WRA Global Social Impact Chatbot, an innovative project that combines the power of the [Textit Platform](https://textit.com/), a spinoff of the open-source platform from UNICEF, [RapidPro](https://github.com/rapidpro/), with WhatsApp Channel API and other open-source resources to create a transformative tool for community engagement and support. This project is inspired by the collaborative framework of the WRA project and aligns with the open-source movement showcased in [RapidPro's Flow Repository](https://community.rapidpro.io/rapidpro-flow-repository/) and the impactful narratives shared in [RapidPro's Stories](https://community.rapidpro.io/stories/). Our aim is to leverage technology for social good on a global scale.


### Project Features:

- **Open Source Flows**: We embrace the open-source community's spirit, offering our chatbot's flows for use and customization. This openness fosters a collaborative environment where innovations can thrive.
- **Advanced Logic**: Our chatbot employs sophisticated logic to manage complex conversation pathways, ensuring users have a smooth and intuitive interaction experience.
- **Multilingual Capabilities**: Recognizing the diversity of our global community, the chatbot supports multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity and broader accessibility.
- **Geographic Specificity**: To provide context-aware responses, the chatbot includes detailed geographic data, including country codes, administrative divisions, and phone codes.
- **Socially Relevant Content**: Drawing from the [What Women Want campaign](https://whiteribbonalliance.org/resources/what-women-want-chatbot-brochure/) by the White Ribbon Alliance, the chatbot is loaded with content that addresses vital community issues, focusing on health, empowerment, and support.

## Our Mission

Aligned with the goals and values of the [White Ribbon Alliance](https://whiteribbonalliance.org/), this project is not just about technology; it's about harnessing that technology for the greater good. Our mission is to create a tool that can reach across borders and barriers, bringing support and information to those who need it most.
